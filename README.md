# Compose AGENTS.md

This repository contains CLI tooling for composing per-project `AGENTS.md` files from modular rule sets.

## Release notes

See `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.

It is intended to be used together with shared rule modules such as:

- `agent-rules/` (public rule modules)
- `agent-rules-private/` (optional, private-only rule modules)

## Install (global CLI)

After publishing to npm, install globally:

```sh
npm install -g compose-agentsmd
```

This provides the `compose-agentsmd` command.

## Rules setup (this repository)

This repository expects the public rules to be available at `agent-rules/rules` via the `agent-rules/` submodule.

Initialize submodules and compose the rules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm install
npm run compose
```

The default ruleset for this repository is `agent-ruleset.json` and currently composes the `node` domain into `AGENTS.md`.

## Compose

From each project root, run:

```sh
compose-agentsmd
```

The tool searches for `agent-ruleset.json` under the given root directory (default: current working directory), and writes output files as specified by each ruleset. If `output` is omitted, it defaults to `AGENTS.md`.

The tool prepends a small "Tool Rules" block to every generated `AGENTS.md` so agents know how to regenerate or update rules.

## Project ruleset format

```json
{
  "source": "github:org/agent-rules@latest",
  "domains": ["node", "unreal"],
  "extra": ["agent-rules-local/custom.md"],
  "output": "AGENTS.md"
}
```

Ruleset keys:

- `source` (required): rules source. Use `github:owner/repo@ref` or a local path.
- `global` (optional): include `rules/global` (defaults to true). Omit this unless you want to disable globals.
- `domains` (optional): domain folders under `rules/domains/<domain>`.
- `extra` (optional): additional local rule files to append.
- `output` (optional): output file name (defaults to `AGENTS.md`).

### Ruleset schema validation

`compose-agentsmd` validates rulesets against `agent-ruleset.schema.json` on every run. If the ruleset does not conform to the schema, the tool exits with a schema error.

### Cache

Remote sources are cached under `~/.agentsmd/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/`. Use `--refresh` to re-fetch or `--clear-cache` to remove cached rules.

### Optional arguments

- `--root <path>`: project root (defaults to current working directory)
- `--ruleset <path>`: only compose a single ruleset file
- `--ruleset-name <name>`: override the ruleset filename (default: `agent-ruleset.json`)
- `--refresh`: refresh cached remote rules
- `--clear-cache`: remove cached remote rules and exit

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```
