# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)
- Before starting any work, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root.
- To update shared rules, run `compose-agentsmd edit-rules`, edit the workspace rules, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules`.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- When updating rules, include a detailed summary of what changed (added/removed/modified items) in the final response.
