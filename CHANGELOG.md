## 3.2.4 - 2026-02-02

- Refactored CLI argument value parsing to reduce duplication.

## 3.2.3 - 2026-02-01

## 3.2.2 - 2026-02-01

- Normalized AGENTS.md Source paths to GitHub-style refs for remote rules and project-relative paths for local rules, with matching test updates.
- Added a pre-commit hook to run lint/test/build.
- Updated the ruleset to use `github:metyatech/agent-rules` with `cli`/`release` domains, removing the local release extra and regenerating AGENTS.md with the shared rules.
